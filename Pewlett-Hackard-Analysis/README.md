# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
According to the retiring_titles table, there are 29,414 Senior Engineers and 28,254 Senior Staff that are getting ready to retire. These two senior positions counts are a lot higher than the other PH retirement titles.

There are only two manager titles in which employees are about to retire. 

There are 1549 employees that are eligible for mentorship yet there are 90,398 employees that will be retiring soon. 

Based on this, there are a lot more employees retiring than are those eligible mentorship. Therefore, all of the 1549 employees eligible for mentorship can have the opportunity to be mentored yet the company will have a large decrease in employees once all those that are eligble to retire do so.

## Summary
In order to avoid a large decrease in employees, PH will need to replace all of the retiring exmployees, approximately 80,000 employees. There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to menor the next generation of PH employees.
